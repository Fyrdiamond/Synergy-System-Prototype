# Synergy System Prototype

## Description
It's the prototype of a synergy tracking system for Douglas M's [Magic is Programming](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/69938/magic-is-programming)

## Goal
The goal of this project was to prove I could make something like this

## Roadmap
- Rewrite in something I hate less than Processing (no offence to anyone who uses it, just not for me.)
- Clearly represent the current area/item being focused to the user
- Enhance sorting functionality to have additional comparison parameeters

## Instructions
1. Download the files in this repository ending in .pde
2. Download [Processing](https://processing.org/download)
3. Drag the files into a new Processing sketch
4. Press play!

## Disclaimer
The web novel this is based on was not created by me, nor has this project been endorsed by its creator.

Also, this project has not been thoroughly bug tested because I could not figure out how to do tests in Processing. It will likely freeze at some point while you use it.
